- The tweet image predictions : This file (image_predictions.tsv) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. It is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv
- Additional data from the Twitter API : Gather each tweet's retweet count and favorite ("like") count at the minimum and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file.
